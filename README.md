# About our app

Pinfinity is a mobile application that allows users to share and discover information using images through pinboards, with a beautiful user interface that is easy to use. The app is built with a client-server architecture, where the front-end and back-end are developed separately, and requests are forwarded through the axios library, a popular JavaScript library for making HTTP requests. The front-end is developed using modern technologies such as React Native, a popular JavaScript framework for building mobile applications, while the back-end is developed using Node.js, a popular JavaScript runtime for building server-side applications.

The app includes several tabs, such as the home tab, search tab, add pins tab, boards tab, and profile update tab, which allow users to navigate through different features of the app easily. Firebase, a popular mobile and web application development platform, is used for user authentication, which ensures that only authorized users can access the app's features.

Pinfinity uses Mongo Atlas, a cloud-based NoSQL database service, to store images uploaded by users. The Multer module is used to handle file uploads in Node.js, making it easy to store and retrieve images from the database. The app also supports CRUD operations, which enable users to create, read, update, and delete pinboards and pins.

The back-end of the app is deployed on Render.com, a cloud-based platform that simplifies the deployment and scaling of web applications. The front-end is bundled as an APK, which users can download and install on their mobile devices.
